Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Coding for building attributes, constructors, and methods in rubric level 1 and 2 works, but when i was trying to import the methods i 
defined in computer.py, i can't import any of the functions except for __init__(). In both computer.py and resale_shop.py, when I tried to
call the functions/methods, I can't call them successfully.

Remember to watch the videos posted on moodle. They are really helpful and direct you to work on the right track. If I watch that 
earlier, I won't struggle on the homework until today (W, Feb 7).

Also, go to TA hours but unfortunately my schedule is too full this week.
